            <h3>New officials appointed for Champions League match suspended after alleged racist incident</h3>
            <p><strong>(NWT) </strong>European football's governing body UEFA has announced that a new refereeing team will officiate the resumption of the Champions League match between Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir, which was marred by alleged racism.</p>

            <p>Tuesday's game was suspended after both teams walked off the pitch in protest after an official was accused of making a racist comment towards Basaksehir assistant coach Pierre Webo, who is Cameroonian.</p>
            <p>After being shown a red card by the match referee, Webo could be heard over the broadcast of French channel RMC Sport repeatedly asking: "Why [did] you say negro?" and pointing at fourth official Sebastian Colţescu.</p>
            <p>UEFA told CNN that Webo's red card has been put on hold as it investigates the incident.</p>
            <p>The match was suspended inside the opening 15 minutes and UEFA announced it would be concluded on Wednesday at the Parc des Princes in Paris.</p>
            <p>UEFA told CNN that Dutch referee Danny Makkelie will lead the new team of officials and will be supported by fellow countryman Mario Diks and Poland's Marcin Boniek.</p>
            <p>Poland's Bartosch Frankowsky will be the new fourth official whilst Italy's Marco Di Bello and Maurizio Mariani will oversee VAR.</p>
